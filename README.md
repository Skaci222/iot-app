## IoT Temperature & Relay Control App

### Description

This project is an IoT application developed in Java that utilizes WiFi provisioning and the MQTT protocol to connect to a temperature and relay device. The app allows users to monitor the temperature, set desired temperature limits, with the option to control a relay by turning it on or off manually. The app uses MQTT Paho for Android and Espressif esp/idf Provisioning library for the IoT device to ensure seamless communication between the mobile app and hardware.

## Key features:

* **Monitor Temperature:** View the current temperature in real-time.
* **Set Temperature Limits:** Configure the target temperature for the device.
* **Relay Control:** Manually turn the relay on or off from the app.
* **WiFi Provisioning:** Easily connect the IoT device to the network.
* **MQTT Protocol:** Use MQTT for efficient, real-time communication between the app and device.
